## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
A small web application built from scratch using the 'create-react-app' NPM package runner. The web application is composed of mostly static pages with text and media content. The web application takes the form of a single page web app making use of the 'react-router' and the 'react-router-dom' packages. Basic concepts of React are implemented such as state, lifecycle, components, event handling, dynamic & conditional rendering. The web app is stylized using Bulma with some style and colours overridden to make the site defaulted to dark-mode. All content is hosted in an external CMS application which is fetched, stored and rendered. The web app is hosted on Heroku making use of auto deployment from the projects GitHub repository through Heroku's pipeline and deployed.
